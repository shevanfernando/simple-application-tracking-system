Enhanced Prompt: CV Improvement for ATS and Hiring Manager Success

Task: Provide In-Depth Suggestions to Improve a CV for Both ATS and Hiring Manager Review

Context:
You are simulating a high-functioning ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and acting as a hiring manager. I need you to thoroughly analyze the provided CV, identify areas where it fails to meet ATS standards, and suggest improvements. The aim is to ensure the CV passes the ATS screening and makes a strong impression on the hiring manager. Additionally, provide a high-quality CV example that demonstrates best practices for formatting, content, and keyword integration that both ATS systems and hiring managers favor.

Inputs:

Current CV:
{{ cv_text }}

Job Description:
{{ job_description }}

Desired Outputs:

ATS Optimization Issues:
Formatting Issues: Highlight any issues with CV formatting that might confuse the ATS (e.g., tables, images, unusual fonts, headers, footers).
Keyword Integration: Identify missing or insufficiently used keywords from the job description that the ATS is likely to prioritize.
Relevance of Keywords: Ensure the keywords are placed in a meaningful context, not just listed. Show how the candidate’s past achievements or experience relate to these keywords.

Hiring Manager Preferences:
Clarity and Readability: Analyze whether the CV is easy to read and logically structured for a hiring manager. Suggest any changes to improve clarity (e.g., better section titles, bullet points, or prioritizing accomplishments).
Highlighting Achievements: Suggest where the CV could better showcase achievements or measurable outcomes, which are typically valued by hiring managers (e.g., “Increased efficiency by 20% through process automation” instead of “Responsible for automating processes”).
Role Alignment: Review the alignment of the CV’s listed experience with the specific responsibilities mentioned in the job description. Suggest improvements to emphasize relevant roles, projects, or technologies that align with the job.

ATS-Friendly Structure Suggestions:
Recommend how to restructure the CV to ensure it is ATS-friendly (e.g., chronological format, appropriate headings, no complex formatting like tables or text boxes).
Optimal Use of Sections: Suggest reordering sections (e.g., moving "Skills" or "Certifications" higher in the CV) to ensure the ATS prioritizes them for keyword matching.

Content Adjustments for ATS and Hiring Managers:
Bullet Points: Offer examples of well-written, concise bullet points that integrate key terms from the job description and demonstrate measurable results.
Experience Section: Suggest improvements in how the work experience section is written, especially with focus on measurable outcomes that align with the job role (e.g., "Developed a Python-based solution, resulting in a 30% reduction in processing time").
Skill Section Optimization: Highlight how the skills section can be adjusted to align with both the job description and ATS keyword scanning, ensuring hard and soft skills are present and relevant.

General Suggestions for ATS Passing:
Correct use of fonts and formatting: Suggest use of standard fonts (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri) and avoid complex formatting to ensure smooth parsing by ATS.
File Type: Recommend submitting the CV in a standard format like a plain-text or PDF (ATS-compatible) to avoid parsing errors.

Clean, ATS-friendly formatting (e.g., no images, tables, or elaborate designs).
